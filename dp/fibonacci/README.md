# Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, it can be defined as follows:

```
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
```
Your task is to write a function that calculates the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.

**Input:**

`n (0 <= n <= 30)`: An integer representing the position of the desired Fibonacci number in the sequence.

**Output:**

Returns the nth Fibonacci number as an integer.

*Ensure that your solution is efficient and can handle larger values of n without significant performance issues.*
