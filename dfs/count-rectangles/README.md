# Problem: Finding Rectangles

Given the following input, find out the number of rectangles present in the array.

```
[
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
]
```

1 represents the area covered by a rectangle. 0 is empty space
